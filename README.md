# RobustTailIndex
These R codes are to accompany the research paper on: "Robust Estimation of Pareto-Type Tail Index through an Exponential Regression Model".
The first file, ERM_M Estimator, computes the proposed ERM_M estimator of the tail index and plots them along the number of top order statistics for two robustness tuning parameter alpha 
The second file IF_function computes the influence function of the parameters of interest i.e. the tail index, and the second-order parameters b_{n,k} and rho.
The third file, Sensitivity, computes the sensitivity measure of the tail index

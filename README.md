# RobustTailIndex
This R code is to accompany the research paper on: "Robust Estimation of Pareto-Type Tail Index through an Exponential Regression Model".
The first file IF computes the influence function of the parameters of interest i.e. the tail index, and the second-order parameters b_{n,k} and rho.
The second file, Sensitivity, computes the sensitivity measure of the tail index
